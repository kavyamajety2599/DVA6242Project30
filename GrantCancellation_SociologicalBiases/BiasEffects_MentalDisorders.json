        "abstract": "pulmonary alveolar homeostasis is dependent upon balanced airway and tissue surfactant pools  alterations in alveolar surfactant pools are associated with inflammation and tissue destruction in severe lung diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and genetic disorders of surfactant dysfunction  we have previously shown that the orphan g protein coupled receptor adgrf5 is a physiologically dominant molecular pathway within alveolar epithelial cells that regulates endogenous alveolar surfactant pools  the ability to pharmacologically modulate the adgrf5 pathway both positively and negatively would be a major therapeutic advance for patients with lung diseases associated with pulmonary surfactant disorders  however the endogenous ligand for adgrf5 has not been identified representing a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of this key surfactant homeostasis mechanism  preliminary data within this application strongly implicate a novel secreted protein from alveolar type ii cells surfactant associated protein 2 sfta2 as a druggable molecular target to modulate endogenous alveolar surfactant pools  we demonstrate that sfta2 is abundantly expressed in human and mouse lung and pulmonary epithelium specific deletion of sfta2 in mice results in early and progressive accumulation of alveolar surfactant  our central hypothesis is that sfta2 regulates alveolar surfactant levels via binding to the extracellular domain of adgrf5 to decrease surfactant secretion and or increase surfactant uptake in at2 cells  the goal of this project is to systematically define the signaling pathways by which sfta2 interacts with adgrf5 to control surfactant homeostasis using cell based assays and mouse genetics through completion of three integrated aims  in the first aim we will test the hypothesis test the hypothesis that sfta2 regulates alveolar surfactant levels via binding and activation of adgrf5 signaling in at2 cells  in the second aim we will test the hypothesis that transient amplification of alveolar surfactant levels via inhibition of the sfta2 adgrf5 signaling axis is sufficient to prevent and or reverse acute lung injury  in the third aim we will define the role of glycosylation in the trafficking and function of sfta2 in homeostasis and in the context of acute lung injury  successful completion of these specific aims will delineate the signaling pathways by which sfta2 adgrf5 senses and regulates surfactant and alveolar homeostasis  the long term goal of this work is to identify potential therapeutic targets including sfta2 itself that will permit modulation of endogenous surfactant levels to treat human lung diseases associated with surfactant dysfunction including acute lung injury ali and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards ",

        "abstract": "this developmental r21 study proposes a secondary data analysis addressing specific questions regarding the mediating pathways by which childhood maltreatment cm experienced by mothers may place their children at greater risk for externalizing and internalizing symptoms in adolescence  using innovative models from developmental neuroscience this study explores novel frameworks for understanding associations between maternal cm and offspring psychopathology  the subsample is drawn from the ongoing family life project flp and is comprised of mothers who reported that they did or did not experience cm at or before the age of 14 n 1122  there is growing interest in the long term consequences of cm and its association with the socioemotional adjustment of survivors and their children  prior research links cm history across numerous domains of adult interpersonal functioning including elevated depression intimate partner violence ipv and problems in the parental role  children of mothers with trauma histories are reported to have significant adjustment difficulties when compared to children of women without self reported cm  despite the strength of evidence linking maternal cm history and offspring psychopathology there is heterogeneity in outcomes for survivors of trauma and their children  our goal is to identify the underlying mechanisms by which maternal cm may be related to psychopathology among offspring in adolescence  we propose a dimensional model of adversity focused on examining how different types of risk factors may be differentially related to the development of children whose mothers report cm  using novel methods to achieve a precise and systematic identification of the processes that account for the heterogeneity of outcomes among offspring of women with cm histories will not only open new avenues for research identifying factors that may protect or interrupt potential links between maternal cm and offspring psychopathology but also provide more clear road maps for future intervention development  a major area of innovation includes the use of a rich longitudinal dataset that has a comprehensive array of biological neurocognitive behavioral caregiving and ecological measures from age 6 months age 16 allowing us perhaps for the first time to examine the intergenerational effects of cm  to our knowledge this is the first study of its kind to test complex longitudinal relations among early adversity deprivation fear learning stress physiology hypervigilance and key outcomes in a racially and economically diverse sample  the high prevalence rates for cm in the united states suggests a significant number of children are living in homes with mothers reporting trauma histories making this an important direction for further inquiry ",

        "abstract": "studying how cortical circuits mature is critical to understanding neurodevelopmental conditions as proper wiring of these circuits is important for perception and cognition  initially spontaneous neuronal activity in the developing neocortex is characterized by intermittent brief bursts of synchronous network events that interrupt much longer periods of no activity  network activity then undergoes a transition from network wide synchronous events to the asynchronous sparse neuronal firing seen in adults  this desynchronization of network activity is a robust phenomenon that is conserved across many species including in humans in mice it occurs during the second postnatal week  because sparse firing is conducive to greater computational coding power desynchronization is a crucial step in neurodevelopment  however the mechanisms driving cortical desynchronization are unknown  understanding these mechanisms would provide insight into the maturation of neural circuits and critically into the origin of neurodevelopmental conditions ndcs such as autism epilepsy and intellectual disability  indeed cortical network synchrony during development is persistently elevated in some mouse models of ndcs suggesting that the trajectory of desynchronization is different in those ndcs  there are two principal mechanisms that could underlie cortical desynchronization 1 intracortical mechanisms and 2 bottom up mechanisms  intracortical mechanisms such as an increase in inhibition or a decrease in intrinsic neuronal excitability could shift the network away from the runaway excitation needed to generate synchronous events  alternatively bottom up mechanisms could directly drive cortical desynchronization via changes in the activity of upstream brain regions like the thalamus  this proposal will compare the primary somatosensory cortex s1 which receives dense bottom up input from the periphery via thalamic relay nuclei to the secondary motor cortex m2 a nearby cortical region that receives little direct input from the periphery to elucidate the contributions of intracortical vs bottom up mechanisms  specific aim 1 will test whether inhibition drives cortical desynchronization in s1 and in m2 by utilizing in vivo longitudinal 2 photon calcium imaging from postnatal days p 9 to 14 to assess how the trajectory of desynchronization changes when local inhibitory interneurons are chronically inhibited with chemogenetics during the desynchronization window  specific aim 2 will determine the role of bottom up mechanisms by testing whether disrupting synchronous thalamic activity can alter the trajectory of cortical desynchronization in s1 and in m2  specific aim 3 will characterize the specific genetic changes occurring in s1 vs m2 during desynchronization using single nucleus rna sequencing  together these aims will provide insight into how cortical circuits mature  crucially this proposal will investigate different regions of cortex with vastly different inputs to disambiguate the contribution of intracortical vs bottom up mechanisms in driving cortical desynchronization ",
