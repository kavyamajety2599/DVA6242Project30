        "abstract": "the purpose of this proposal is to develop clinical prediction tools to risk stratify patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis  because the course of sarcoidal inflammation lasts for many years even in those with self limiting sarcoid the lack of prognostic indicators upon which to develop a management plan is not a trivial issue for both patient and physician  thus without prognostication tools clinicians will not be able to improve the longitudinal care they provide for the types of outcomes that are used in the clinic  the conception of this study was motivated by the preliminary data showing that levels of blood protein and rna transcripts related to interferon inflammation were predictive of future declines in lung function using cox proportional hazards modeling  an important feature of the study design is the focus on clinically relevant outcomes and clinical variables so that results can be immediately translated into clinical practice  this goal is realized in aim 1 in which we will deliver the best performing clinical prediction model that relies only on clinically available data and lab tests to predict a clinical outcome used in pulmonary clinics to define sarcoidosis disease progression  this outcome is a clinically meaningful decline in lung function  in aim 2 we will measure the added value of incorporating novel blood based interferon related markers into the clinical prediction models  the goal of this aim is to identify which novel markers should be developed and moved into the clinical arena for use in sarcoidosis prognostication  finally in aim 3 we will apply these models to an important clinical management problem in sarcoidosis which is identifying the optimal monitoring frequency for a given patient  addressing this last question is the first step towards being able to better anticipate disease progression before extensive organ damage occurs  the team of sarcoidosis investigators are highly qualified to execute this study because they have a track record of performing sarcoidosis clinical research have ongoing collaborations and have participated in prior studies that involve biospecimen collection from patients including nih sponsored consortium studies  to execute this study the investigators will contribute longitudinal biospecimens and clinical data from 357 patients with sarcoidosis that have been enrolled in longitudinal cohorts at centers across the us  two hundred additional patients will be enrolled and followed for up to 39 months leading to a total sample size of 557 of which a majority will be african american  our team also includes a uniquely qualified biostatistician dr charles mcculloch who has pioneered aspects of the longitudinal modeling approach we will be using  therefore the proposed aims have a high likelihood of success for tackling this long overdue clinical problem ",

        "abstract": "single cell rna sequencing scrna seq provides genome wide information about gene expression at the resolution of individual cells  the unprecedented scope of these data is revolutionizing our understanding of development and tissue homeostasis as well as diseases like cancer  a major issue with scrna seq however is the shear scale of the data consisting of 20 000 gene expression measurements in thousands to millions of cells  effective computational approaches are clearly required to translate data of this size and complexity into actionable biological insights  for instance scrna seq data are approximately 20 000 dimensional and as a result all available analysis pipelines rely on multiple dimensionality reduction steps  this usually entails a combination of linear tools like pca and non linear techniques like t sne and umap  the data is generally reduced to between 10 and 100 d for data analysis e g  clustering into distinct cell types and 2 d for visualization  the problem however is that dimensionality reduction can lead to loss of information  we recently showed that this loss of information is dramatic for any given cell over 95 of its neighbors are changed in the process of dimensionality reduction  this complete change in the structure of the data can introduce significant noise and bias into the analysis and suggests the critical need for alternative approaches  the premise of this application is that reducing bias in scrna seq data analysis will maximize our ability to extract meaningful information from the data  in this proposal we focus on developing new algorithms to address three specific steps in the typical analysis pipeline 1 dimensionality reduction our hypothesis is that deep neural networks can be explicitly trained to maximize the amount of information that can be retained for both data analysis and visualization   2 feature selection not all genes are equally informative for downstream analyses so researchers generally choose a subset of genes based on variation in the population  we have shown that standard approaches to selecting genes convolve true biological variation with technical noise from the experiment  we hypothesize that statistical models based on our understanding of sources of technical noise can be used to select more informative genes   3 cell clustering clustering the data to determine cell types is critical but cells with different identities often form complex overlapping geometries in gene expression space that are difficult for existing algorithms to resolve  our hypothesis is that new clustering tools guided by prior knowledge and leveraging innovations in clustering from image segmentation can overcome this problem  we will build these new tools and test them against existing benchmark datasets and novel data generated by our experimental collaborators  we will also integrate these tools into popular scrna seq analysis packages  successful completion of the proposed work will allow the field to extract more biologically relevant information from the burgeoning set of scrna seq datasets ",

        "abstract": "a specific aims diabetes is widespread in the united states and its complications have devastating effects on health and quality of life  impaired wound healing is a serious complication that leads to the development of chronic wounds in the lower extremities  patients with such wounds display decreased mobility and overall health and are the most frequently subjected to limb amputation  five year mortality following major amputation is over 80  wound care practices can be effective but a large fraction of diabetic ulcers still persist or lead to amputation  novel therapeutic strategies must focus on the pathological mechanisms underlying impaired healing in order to improve patient outcomes  wounds become chronic due to diabetic hyperglycemia including reduced blood flow hypoxia and aberrant behavior of immune cells fibroblasts and keratinocytes that are critical to healing  recent unbiased analyses such as single rna seq have revealed the critical involvement of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix ecm production  surprisingly little attention has been paid to the role of ecm proteins as negative modulators of healing  work in our laboratory suggests the contribution of the matricellular protein thrombospondin 2 tsp 2 to diabetic wounds  normally tsp 2 is expressed in wounds and contributes to ecm remodeling and vascular regression in part by increasing and decreasing the levels of matrix metalloproteinase mmp 2 9 and lysyl oxidase lox and ecm crosslinking respectively  our recent work has shown that tsp 2 is elevated in the wounds of diabetic patients and mice suggesting a correlation between compromised wound healing and high tsp 2 expression  these findings allowed us to put forward the overarching premise that abnormal ecm production and assembly contribute to prevention of wound closure  we obtained partial confirmation for this hypothesis by generating diabetic mice lacking tsp2 dbdb dko mice and observed normalization of healing  in this application we propose studies to explore and exploit ecm phenotypes in diabetes  specifically we plan to characterize ecm abnormalities and their contribution to cell dysfunction in vitro and in vivo  in addition the newly generated dbdb dko mouse will be used to probe a novel ecm phenotype  we also aim to translate our findings into a bioengineering approach that will provide proof of principle for the utilization of novel ecms as part of a combinatorial therapeutic strategy  these studies will include ecm obtained from a tsp2 ko pig that we have created for the provision of clinical grade materials  accordingly the specific aims of this application are specific aim 1 to test the hypothesis that fibroblast dysfunction and altered ecm production and assembly in diabetes contribute to delayed wound closure  we will perform wound healing in these mice and monitor recovery of biomechanical integrity a critical aspect of healing  we will also perform in vitro studies to investigate the indirect impact of diabetes on cell functions by studying the interactions of dermal fibroblasts with ecm derived from wt or dbdb mice  specifically we will evaluate migration production of traction forces and contraction  inclusion of cell derived ecm and cells from dbdb dko mice will allow us to probe the role of tsp2 in greater detail  in order to obtain a broader understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the diabetes induced fibroblast dysfunction we will perform bulk rna sequencing and pathway analysis of all genotypes  specific aim 2 to test the hypothesis that novel engineered native constructs can restore healing in diabetic animals  we have previously shown that decellularized skin constructs and skin derived hydrogels from tsp2 ko mice can increase cellular integration vessel maturation and healing in diabetic mice  in this aim we will combine such constructs with drug delivery approaches to develop combinatorial strategies  these studies will be complemented by skin derived ecm derived from our newly created tsp2 ko pigs  specifically we will prepare drug loaded tsp2 null constructs embedded with alginate microspheres to combat infections reduce chronic inflammation and restore healing  full thickness excisional wounds will be made and the rate of healing will be quantified through daily measurements of wound area  additionally wounds will be subjected to histological and immunohistochemical stains in order to assess wound closure epithelialization inflammation angiogenesis and ecm remodeling  completion of this project should allow us to establish a major molecular mechanism in impaired wound healing which could inform the development of engineering solutions to non healing wounds  in exciting parallel studies we have generated a tsp2 ko pig which we anticipate will be used to produce ecm based products for clinical use  we believe the proposed rigorous studies in this application will provide significant support for the advancement of regenerative ecm constructs towards the clinic ",

worse for underrepresented minorities urm who represent 39 of college age individuals yet only 13 of phds in life sciences  in 2015 we were awarded a nigm r25 initiative for maximizing student development rush imsd  rush r25 imsd was charged with training pre doctoral urms in biological sciences at rush university in chicago il  although rush r25 imsd was a budding program we achieved an impressive track record in our first 5 years of training and retaining of phd urms students some of whom received f31s and or research supplement awards  this formal structure dedicated to urm phd training a first at rush was instrumental in building alliances to promote urm education within and outside of our university  specifically rush r25 imsd is a documented success aligned with institutional commitment for diversity and inclusion  with the recognition that minorities continue to be underrepresented in phd life science programs and consequently the biomedical workforce does not reflect the diversity of our nation we propose a new program for training of urm phd students at rush university under a t32 mechanism as nigm is phasing out r25 imsds  the pillars of t32 imsd rush is a triad of rigorous mentoring education and research training of pre doctoral urm students through harnessing the expertise of nationally recognized mentors and program faculty across several departments  three students per year will be selected to participate in t32 imsd rush and supported for the first three years of matriculation an additional participant will be under institutional support  together we expect a cohort of 20 students over five years  the overarching goal of t32 imsd rush will be attained through two interrelated specific aims 1 train emerging urm scientists in technical and operational basis of discipline based research t32 imsd rush will be inter and multidisciplinary program for training of urm phd students in one of several disciplines immunology microbiology physiology and biophysics cell and molecular medicine neurologic sciences orthopedics bioengineering  participants will select a discipline and be matched with a primary mentor who along with nationally recognized leaders will guide the research development of the participant from idea conception to successful execution e g the operational phase of training include knowledge acquisition rigorous experimental design and data interpretation  participants will also be trained in highly innovative and cutting edge technology that can be used across disciplines to address impactful scientific questions and discoveries through designated workshops in imaging live cell imaging ct scans confocal microscopy small animal models animal care humanized mice transgenic rats molecular approaches rna dna scope quantitative gene knockdown quantitative and computational approaches high input statistics bioinformatics and training in scientific reproducibility and rigor  the participants will be captured early and integrated into the program through pre matriculation summer training modules  milestones include submission and acquisition of nih individual predoctoral awards f31 or individual predoctoral to postdoctoral fellow transition award f99 k00 publication of two peer reviewed manuscripts one of which as a first author and successful completion of the phd program  2 implement and optimize best practices for training of emerging urm science investigators classical mentorship relies heavily on scientific research prowess  there is a greater recognition and appreciation that mentorship should be a holistic strategy combining training in rigor in research with professional skills and network alliance building to facilitate the development of a well rounded emerging scientist one who will successfully face the challenges of academic research in particular and of science in general  t32 imsd rush will provide urm mentorship through direct and regular one on one contact and organized activities through workshops to maximize each participant s professional development  these programs will include training modules on poster and oral presentations emotional intelligence conflict resolution verbal and non verbal communication negotiations financial budgeting fiscal responsibility of running a team and or lab interviewing skills and most importantly building a culture of inclusion as a supportive network for urms  best practices will be used to train the participants  mentors program faculty will undergo mentorship training established by the national research mentoring network nrmn  collectively these initiatives are the cornerstones to ensure that t32 imsd rush participants will be fully prepared to navigate the demands and challenges facing urm scientists  t32 imsd rush will be evaluated through a well integrated process to track report and assess long term outcomes of trainees  our findings will be shared through open dissemination of information and networking with organizations with similar interest  our long term goal is to increase enrollment of phd urm students in biomedical sciences at rush by at least 50 with 90 successfully completing the program and 50 will choose post graduate training  also we envision that t32 imsd rush instituted model for graduate student training will evolve into a platform that has university and community sustainability and sustained partnerships ",

        "abstract": "a vaccine is urgently needed to protect pregnant women from malaria infection and the devastating effects of this disease on maternal and child health  two vaccines are in early stage clinical trials and both target domains within the protein var2csa which is the major surface antigen expressed by plasmodium falciparum placental isolates  this protein binds to receptors in the placenta and mediates sequestration of infected red blood cells irbcs underpinning the pathogenesis of placental malaria  however var2csa is under strong immune selection and is highly polymorphic this compromises vaccine efficacy by limiting the breadth of protection against diverse alleles  polymorphic antigens present a ubiquitous challenge in the development of malaria subunit vaccines  the long term goal of this project is to develop an alternative approach to a vaccine against pregnancy associated malaria that targets highly conserved subdominant even cryptic epitopes  what is unique about this approach is that it exploits a mechanism of cross species immunity where epitopes from one plasmodium species elicit robust broadly neutralizing antibodies against structurally related antigens from another species  this mechanism was discovered recently in colombian and brazilian populations where var2csa antibodies can be acquired outside of pregnancy following infection with p vivax and these antibodies blocked sequestration of irbcs using in vitro correlates of placental malaria  the cross reactive epitope in p vivax was mapped to subdomain sd1 in pvdbp and human sd1 purified antibodies blocked parasite adhesion  the objective of this project is to develop a vaccine to protect pregnant women from falciparum placental malaria that is based on the cross reactive epitope in vivax sd1  this will be achieved through synthesis of three complementary specific aims  epitopes required to elicit functional cross reactive antibodies will be identified in aim 1 through conformationally constricted peptide microarrays screened with mouse monoclonal antibodies mabs and human mabs to sd1 isolated from colombian study populations  epitopes will be synthesized as peptide conjugates or within engineered recombinant domains and immunogenicity will be optimized in aim 2 to produce antibodies with functional activity against parasites that express diverse alleles of var2csa  in the third aim the cryptic epitopes in var2csa recognized by these antibodies will be mapped to identify the targets of antibodies elicited by an sd1 derived vaccine  the integration of these findings will provide important insight into the mechanism of cross species epitope recognition which will serve as the basis for a vivax vaccine against falciparum placental malaria and could be applied more broadly to vaccines against other malaria antigens ",
